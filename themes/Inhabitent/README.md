Inhabitent 

A website based on WordPress CMS using a combination of PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, Sass and HTML/CSS. The website includes multiple pages based on the WordPress heirarchy and consists of a combination of journal posts and product content. This was a 2 weeks long project built as part of RED Academy's web development program in Toronto. This project served as an introduction to custom WordPress theming without using Word Press themes.

Personal Learnings

As with other projects, we were given design comps and asked to replicate them as closely as possible, which required a substantial amount of CSS and WordPress specific functionality such as custom post types, plugins, widgets etc.

One of the main challenges I encountered was figuring out how to target pages individually so that I could write styles without affecting every page of a certain type. This led me to familiarize myself with WordPress body classes as well as SASS nesting functionality which was a very handy tool for writing specific style rules. 

This project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding in using WordPress and navigating through the template heirarchy. It was confusing at first but as I worked through it, it became more clear. Working with WordPress also taught me how powerful WordPress backend actually is especially with multiple plugins and widgets that gave me more flexibility in building the website.
